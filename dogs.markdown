    <h1>Meet Our Portuguese Water Dogs</h1>
    <p>Our dogs are the heart of our breeding program. Each has been carefully selected for their health, temperament, and adherence to the breed standard. We consider them family members first and foremost.</p>

      <h3>More Than Just Dogs - They're Family</h3>
      <p>At Stella Maris, our Portuguese Water Dogs aren't just part of our breeding programâ€”they're beloved members of our family. They live in our home, sleep on our beds, and share in all our family adventures. From beach trips and mountain hikes to quiet evenings by the fire, our dogs are constant companions in our daily lives.</p>
      <p>We believe this family integration is essential for developing well-adjusted, confident dogs with excellent temperaments. Our puppies are raised in a home environment with plenty of love, socialization, and exposure to everyday household activities. The deep bond we share with our dogs reflects our commitment to raising Portuguese Water Dogs that are not only physically sound but emotionally balanced and ready to become cherished family members in their forever homes.</p>

        <p>Arthy is our distinguished male champion with an exceptional temperament and structure.
