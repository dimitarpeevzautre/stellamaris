        <h3>History & Heritage</h3>
        <p>Originally bred along the coast of Portugal, these remarkable dogs were indispensable companions to fishermen for centuries. They were trained to herd fish into nets, retrieve lost tackle or broken nets, and act as couriers from ship to shore.</p>
        <p>As modern fishing methods evolved, the breed's numbers declined significantly by the mid-20th century. Thanks to dedicated breeding programs, the Portuguese Water Dog was saved from extinction and has since gained recognition and popularity worldwide.</p>

        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>PWDs are medium-sized, robust dogs with strong, athletic builds that reflect their working heritage. They typically stand 17-23 inches tall and weigh between 35-60 pounds, with males generally larger than females.</p>
        <p>One of their most distinctive features is their coat, which comes in two varieties: the curly coat (compact, cylindrical curls) and the wavy coat (falling in gentle waves). The breed is known for being non-shedding and is often considered suitable for people with allergies.</p>
        <p>PWDs come in various colors, including black, white, brown, and combinations with white markings. Their expressive eyes and intelligent expression reflect their alert, attentive nature.</p>

        <h3>Temperament & Personality</h3>
        <p>Portuguese Water Dogs are known for their intelligence, trainability, and boundless energy. They are loyal, loving companions who form strong bonds with their families. Their working heritage has given them an eagerness to please that makes them highly trainable, though they can sometimes be independent thinkers.</p>
        <p>They are generally good with children and can adapt well to other pets when properly socialized. PWDs are social creatures who thrive on interaction and can become unhappy if left alone for long periods.</p>
        <p>These dogs have retained their love of water and swimming, living up to their name. Their playful, exuberant nature and need for regular exercise make them best suited to active families who can provide plenty of mental and physical stimulation.</p>

      <h3>Health & Care</h3>
      <p>Portuguese Water Dogs are generally healthy, with a life expectancy of 11-13 years. Like all breeds, they are prone to certain health conditions, including hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, and certain genetic disorders. Responsible breeders screen their stock for these conditions to minimize health risks.</p>
      <p>Their distinctive coat requires regular grooming to prevent matting. Most PWD owners opt for a "retriever clip" (shorter all over) or a "lion clip" (hindquarters and muzzle shaved, with a mane-like appearance) to keep their dogs comfortable and looking their best.</p>
      <p>These energetic dogs need regular exercise—at least an hour daily—including opportunities to swim when possible. Mental stimulation through training, puzzle toys, and varied activities is equally important for this intelligent breed.</p>
