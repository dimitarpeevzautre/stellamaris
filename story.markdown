    <h1>Our Journey with Portuguese Water Dogs</h1>
    <p>Our journey began in 2005 when we fell in love with the Portuguese Water Dog breed. What started as a passion quickly evolved into a dedicated commitment to preserving and promoting these exceptional dogs.</p>

        <h3>Our Beginning</h3>
        <p>Stella Maris Kennel was founded with a clear mission: to breed healthy, well-tempered Portuguese Water Dogs that excel as both working companions and beloved family members. Our name, meaning "Star of the Sea," reflects both the maritime heritage of these ocean-loving dogs and our guiding principles in breeding.</p>
        <p>Located in Sofia, Bulgaria, we've dedicated ourselves to understanding and preserving the PWD's unique characteristics while ensuring each puppy we raise has the best possible start in life.</p>

        <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
        <p>At Stella Maris, we believe in breeding for health, temperament, and adherence to breed standards. Every breeding decision we make is guided by extensive research, health testing, and a deep understanding of genetics.</p>
        <p>We're committed to responsible breeding practices that prioritize the well-being of our dogs over all other considerations. Each litter receives exceptional care, early socialization, and comprehensive health screening.</p>

        <p>We regularly participate in dog shows, water trials, and other events that showcase the versatility and capabilities of the Portuguese Water Dog. Our commitment extends beyond breeding to education, support, and promotion of this wonderful breed.</p>
