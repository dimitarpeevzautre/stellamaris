    <h1>Stella Maris Portuguese Water Dog Puppies</h1>
    <p>At Stella Maris, we take immense pride in how we raise our Portuguese Water Dog puppies. Our comprehensive approach ensures that each puppy leaves our care with the best possible start in life.</p>

        <h3>Early Neurological Stimulation</h3>
        <p>We implement the Bio-Sensor program (also known as the "Super Dog" program) from days 3-16. This program involves gentle stimulation exercises that help strengthen the puppies' neurological systems and improve their stress tolerance, heart rate, and immune responses.</p>

        <h3>Socialization & Enrichment</h3>
        <p>From birth through 8 weeks, our puppies experience a carefully designed socialization protocol. This includes exposure to different surfaces, sounds, people, and experiences. We introduce age-appropriate toys, puzzles, and environments to stimulate cognitive development and build confidence.</p>

        <h3>Health & Veterinary Care</h3>
        <p>All puppies receive thorough veterinary check-ups, appropriate vaccinations, deworming, and microchipping before going to their new homes. We conduct early health screenings to ensure each puppy is developing properly.</p>

      <div class="puppy-info-item fade-in-section">
        <h3>Temperament Assessment</h3>
        <p>We conduct formal temperament evaluations to help match each puppy with the right family. These assessments help us understand each puppy's individual personality traits, energy level, and training aptitude.</p>

        <h3>Early Training Foundations</h3>
        <p>By the time our puppies leave for their new homes, they have already been introduced to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Crate training basics</li>
          <li>Potty training introduction</li>
          <li>Basic name recognition</li>
          <li>Handling and grooming acceptance</li>
          <li>Initial leash introduction</li>
          <li>Household sounds and environments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This early foundation makes the transition to their new homes much smoother for both puppies and their families.</p>

      <h3>Current & Upcoming Litters</h3>
      <p>We carefully plan our litters to ensure the health and quality of our puppies. Please visit our <a href="litters.html">Litters page</a> for information about current and upcoming litters.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in a Stella Maris puppy, we encourage you to submit an <a href="apply.html">application</a> and learn more about our placement process. We maintain a waiting list for future litters and prioritize suitable homes that have completed our application process.</p>

        <h3>Puppy Stages</h3>
        <p>We document each puppy's development from birth through 8 weeks. This allows families to see their puppy grow and develop even before they come home. Our comprehensive puppy journal includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Weekly photos and videos</li>
          <li>Weight and growth measurements</li>
          <li>Milestone achievements</li>
          <li>Personality development notes</li>
          <li>Socialization experiences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Families on our waiting list receive regular updates on their puppy's progress, creating a connection long before bringing their new family member home.</p>
